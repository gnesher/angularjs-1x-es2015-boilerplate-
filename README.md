# angularjs-1x-es2015-boilerplate-
boilerplate for new AngularJS 1.x apps using es2015. Based on https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide

Yes, I realise there are plenty similar boilerplates online, but they never quite match what I need and this saves me
a lot of time while when I move between contracts

Comments / suggestions are always welcomed
